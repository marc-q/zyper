# zyper
A little typing game written in plain C.

### How to compile the source code:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the zyper.c file.
2. Run "make zyper.c". It should be making the binary zyper.
3. Run "./zyper" to use the default wordbook or "./zyper [wordbook file]" to use an custom wordbook.
4. Have fun and find out how many word's you can type in one minute.
